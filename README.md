### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Eze Henry, a software developer based in Nigeria.
I have been writing Javascript for over 4 years and I have been writing vue.js for over 3 years and node.js for 2 years. I have a total of 3 years of working experience where I worked with companies like [BangerGames](http://bangergames.com/) where I built a vast majority of their responsive frontend, I also worked at [varscon](https://www.varscongroup.com/) where I worked on full-stack applications for various clients using the MEVN stack and many other clients.

I have a lot of experience building mobile-first applications and very complex, accessible and performant applications.
I am a very great learner and have a very great foundation in software engineering.
I also have a lot of experience working in startups as majorities of companies I have worked in have been startups and I have experience starting a startup myself.
